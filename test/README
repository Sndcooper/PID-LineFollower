# Test & Experiments — The Creative Lab

This folder is a **sandbox for tuning and validation**. Each sketch here is a standalone Arduino experiment—not a PlatformIO unit test, but a focused trial to verify sensors, tune PID gains, or explore new logic.

## 🧪 What Lives Here

### Line Following Variants
Development of different sensor strategies:
- **three_ir_working.cpp** — The stable 3‑IR baseline. Fast, simple, reliable.
- **five_ir_working.cpp** — Extended 5‑IR array for finer edge detection and sharper turns.
- **five_ir_test.cpp** — Threshold comparison and turn response tuning.
- **five_ir_smoothing.cpp** — Smooth acceleration/deceleration to reduce jerky transitions.
- **line_follow_overshoot_tuning.cpp** — Experiments to minimize overshoot on corners.

### PID & Encoder Balancing
Direct motor and encoder validation:
- **pid_straight_line.cpp** — Custom PID loop using encoder feedback; keeps motors balanced.
- **pid_library_balance.cpp** — PID_v1 library baseline for motor synchronization.
- **pid_library_tuning.cpp** — Higher‑gain PID_v1 runs with detailed output logging.
- **encoder_forward_test.cc** — Wiring sanity check; confirms motor direction conventions.

### Data & Reference
- **matlab_sim_data.txt** — Logged encoder/motor values for MATLAB simulation and offline analysis.
- **encodertestcodes/** — Encoder interrupt utilities and reference code.
- **MotorTest/** — Arduino Nano CPU benchmark and hardware validation sketches.

## 🔬 How to Use
1. Pick a sketch based on what you want to test (line following, PID tuning, encoder reading).
2. Upload to the Nano and open Serial Monitor (9600 baud).
3. Observe sensor outputs, motor speeds, and PID corrections.
4. Tweak constants and re‑upload to refine behavior.
5. Save promising results or log data for offline analysis.

## 📝 Tips
- Each sketch is self‑contained; don't mix assumptions from multiple files.
- Motor direction wiring is consistent across sketches—verify once, trust forever.
- Use MATLAB to plot the logged data and visualize PID response.
- Encoder values let you debug motor mismatch without line sensors.
