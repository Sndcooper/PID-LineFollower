This folder contains development sketches and tuning experiments for the line follower.
They are not PlatformIO unit tests—each file is a standalone Arduino sketch used to
validate sensors, encoders, and PID behavior during iteration.

Highlights:
- 3-IR and 5-IR line-following logic variants
- Speed smoothing and overshoot tuning
- Encoder-only PID balance tests
- Data logs exported for MATLAB simulation
